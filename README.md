# Cache Pattern

The provided code is for a class called "CacheManager" that uses Microsoft's IMemoryCache to manage caching data in a .NET application. The class has methods for adding and removing data from the cache, as well as retrieving data from the cache. Some of these methods are asynchronous and run on a separate task, while others are synchronous. The cache data is stored with an absolute expiration time, which is specified in seconds and set using the MemoryCacheEntryOptions class.
